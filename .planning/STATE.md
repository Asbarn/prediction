# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-21)

**Core value:** Accurately detect and quantify real arbitrage opportunities between prediction market prices and options-implied probabilities -- with every false signal caught before it costs money.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 9-phase comprehensive structure -- split original 6-phase research suggestion into 9 for clearer delivery boundaries (separated feed reliability from connection, multi-venue from event mapping, pricing engine from signal generation)
- [Roadmap]: Deribit feed first -- proves entire pipeline architecture before adding Polymarket/Kalshi complexity
- [Roadmap]: Prediction market arb before cross-asset -- validates pipeline end-to-end with simpler probability-vs-probability math before adding Black-76

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 4]: Polymarket has two separate WS endpoints (CLOB and RTDS) with different semantics -- needs research during planning
- [Phase 4]: Kalshi uses RSA-PSS auth which requires the `rsa` crate -- needs research during planning
- [Phase 7]: statrs 0.18 requires Rust 1.87+ -- verify toolchain or implement Normal CDF manually
- [Phase 7]: Risk premium calibration needs 2-4 weeks of parallel data collection before signals are meaningful
